# Weather Forecast with Generative Adversarial Networks 
Using Generative Adversarial Networks (Improved Video GAN) for Weather Forecast

Base of the code base is [Improved Video GAN github](https://github.com/bernhard2202/improved-video-gan),
because of their nicely kept repo and usage of the Tensorflow.

I will try to reconstruct the repo to Python3, as well, the newest Tensorflow (TODO).
